# Merge multiple results of several algorithms and show them on one plot
# Copy this file in the parent directory where the runs of all of your algorithms reside.
# e.g:
# /Project
# /Project/Algorithm1
# /Project/Algorithm2
# /Project/Algorithm3
# /Project/Algorithm4
# copy merge.py in /Project
# OR set the path to the correct location
# If you want to select a set of runs you can pass a list of paths that you would like to be considered.
