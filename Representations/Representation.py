## The Representation is the \ref Agents.Agent.Agent "Agent"'s model of the \ref Domains.Domain.Domain "Domain".
# 
# As the Agent interacts with the Domain, it receives state updates. The Agent passes these associated state-action / state-action pairings
# along with the associated reward for each timestep to its
# %Representation, which is responsible for maintaining the value function for each state, usually in some
# lower-dimensional feature space.
# Agents can later query the %Representation for the value of being in a state V(s) or the value of taking an action
# in a particular state ( known as the Q-function, Q(s,a) ).
#
# The \c %Representation class is a superclass that provides the basic framework for all representations. It provides the methods and attributes
# that allow child classes to interact with the \c Agent and \c Domain classes within the RLPy library. \n
# All new representation implimentations should inherit from \c %Representation.
# \note It is assumed that the Linear Function approximator family of representations is being used.
