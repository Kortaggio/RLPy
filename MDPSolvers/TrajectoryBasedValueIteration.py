# Trajectory Based Value Iteration. This algorithm is different from Value iteration in 2 senses:
# 1. It works with any Linear Function approximator
# 2. Samples are gathered using the e-greedy policy
# The algorithm terminates if the maximum bellman-error in a consequent set of trajectories is below a threshold
