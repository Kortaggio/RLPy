## The Policy determines the action that an \ref Agents.Agent.Agent "Agent" will take given its \ref Representations.Representation.Representation "Representation".
# 
# The Agent learns about the \ref Domains.Domain.Domain "Domain" as the two interact. Each step, the Agent passes information about its current state and information
# relevant to that state to the %Policy. The %Policy uses this information to decide what action the Agent should perform next. \n
#
# The \c %Policy class is a superclass that provides the basic framework for all policies. It provides the methods and attributes
# that allow child classes to interact with the \c Agent and \c Representation classes within the RLPy library. \n
# All new policy implementations should inherit from \c %Policy.
