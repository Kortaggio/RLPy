# ---OBJECTIVE--- \n
# Reward is 1 within the goal region, 0 elsewhere.
# The episode terminates if x leaves its bounds, [-2.4, 2.4]
#
# Pendulum starts straight down, theta = pi, with the
# cart at x = 0.
# (see CartPole parent class for coordinate definitions).
#
# The objective is to get and then keep the pendulum in the goal
# region for as long as possible, with +1 reward for
# each step in which this condition is met; the expected
# optimum then is to swing the pendulum vertically and
# hold it there, collapsing the problem to Pendulum_InvertedBalance
# but with much tighter bounds on the goal region.
#
# (See CartPole implementation in the RL Community,
# http://library.rl-community.org/wiki/CartPole)
