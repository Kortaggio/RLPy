# This is a simple simulation of Remote Controlled Car in a room with no obstacle \n \n
# Based on http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node658.html. We refer to it as webpage. \n \n
# State: x,y (center point on the line connecting the back wheels), speed (S on the webpage), heading (theta on the webpage)
# heading is the angle with respect to the body frame. positive values => Turning right. Negative values => Turning left \n
# Actions: [Accelerate forward, 0, Accelerate backward] x [Turn left, 0, Turn Right]. The second argument is phi based on the webpage  \n
# Reward: -1 per step, 100 at goal.
