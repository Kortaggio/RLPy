# ---OBJECTIVE--- \n
# Reward 1 is received on each timestep spent within the goal region,
# zero elsewhere.
# This is also the terminal condition.
#
# RL Community has the following bounds for failure: \n
# theta: [-12, 12] degrees  -->  [-pi/15, pi/15] \n
# x: [-2.4, 2.4] meters \n
#
# Pendulum starts straight up, theta = 0, with the
# cart at x = 0.
# (see CartPole parent class for coordinate definitions).
#
# Note that the reduction in angle limits affects the resolution
# of the discretization of the continuous space.
#
# Note that if unbounded x is desired, set x (and/or xdot) limits to
# be [float("-inf"), float("inf")]
#
# \note The reward scheme is different from that in Pendulum_InvertedBalance
#
# (See CartPole implementation in the RL Community,
# http://library.rl-community.org/wiki/CartPole)
