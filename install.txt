Python 2.7\n\nCheck to see if python is already installed by opening a terminal in anyOS and typing:\n> python --version\n\nIf you do not see the output "Python 2.7.3", download and install python,for example, from ( http://www.python.org/getit/ )\n\n===============================================================\n===============================================================\n2. An IDE capable of development in Python\n\nInstall a development environment of choice with Python support.\nWe recommend Eclipse Classic.  Note that eclipse requires the Java SDK.\nTo obtain Eclipse, download and follow the instructions:\ni) Download+Install Eclipse Classic ( http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ )\nii) Install Pydev for Eclipse ( http://pydev.org/manual_101_install.html )\n\nSee FAQ if eclipse fails to run.\n\n===============================================================\n===============================================================\n2.5. pip\na) Windows 32/64-bit\nInstall per instructions here:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-to-install-pip-on-windows\n\nb) Ubuntu Linux - automated in script\nc) Mac OSX - automated in script\n\n===============================================================\n===============================================================\n3. Run the dependency installer script\n\nFIRST ensure the RLPy directory is located in the workspace folder of yourIDE, or whatever final location you intend it to be.\nNEXT Extract the relevant installer zip file (RLPy-*.zip, where '*'is Windows, Ubuntu, or MacOS) into the 'Installation' folder in the RLPy directory.\n\nTHEN:\n\na) Windows 32-bit\na.i) Open a command prompt window with administrative privileges:\n	Windows 8: 		 WindowsKey-X, select "Command Prompt Admin"\n	Windows 7,Vista: type 'cmd' in the start menu, right click and open with admin privileges\n	Windows XP:      Start-->Run cmd.exe\na.ii) Navigate to the Install directory and run the .bat script.\n\n\n\nb) Ubuntu - Open a terminal window, navigate to the Installation folder,and run the provided script with ./ubuntu_setup.sh\n\n*** If the script fails to run, first type:\nchmod u+x ubuntu_setup.sh\n*** and re-run it.\n\n\n\nc) Mac OSX\nc.i) The Command Line Tools (CLT) and/or XCode are required to use the script.If you are unsure of your setup, type " xcode-select --version " at a terminal.\nIf you don't see a valid version number appear, follow the instructions here tosetup your environment: ( http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/ )\n\nc.ii) Open a terminal window, navigate to the Installation folder,and run the provided script with ./OSX_setup.sh\n\n*** If the script fails to run, first type:\nchmod u+x OSX_setup.sh\n*** and re-run it.\n\n===============================================================\n===============================================================\nInstallation of RLPy is now complete!\n\n4. Now open the framework in your IDE of choice.\n\nIf using Eclipse:\ni) Go to file -> switch workspace -> other\nAnd navigate to the folder containing RLPy (NOT the RLPy folder itself.)\n\nii) Go to file -> import -> general -> existing projects into workspaceAnd select 'Browse.'  Navigate into the RLPy directory and select 'Next.'\nYou should now see the RLPy directory structure in the left pane.\n\n===============================================================\n===============================================================\n\nThat's it!\n\nNow take a look at the \ref First_Run Getting Started Tutorial page,and (as part of the tutorial) test the installation by running IshouldRun.py.\nFinally, start experimenting with RLPy yourself!\n\nIf you encountered errors in the installation, see the FAQ section at bottom\n(and an extended FAQ located in the FAQ.txt file).\n\n\n\n\section install_faq Insallation FAQ: Error/SolutionsU = Ubuntu, W = Windows, X = OSX\n===============================================================\nIf you are having trouble installing on OSX, see the following:\nhttp://www.thisisthegreenroom.com/2011/installing-python-numpy-scipy-matplotlib-and-ipython-on-lion/#numpy\n\n===============================================================\nE: Generic messages about missing environmental variables\nS1: Ensure that the environment variable 'RL_PYTHON_ROOT' is set on your OS forwhatever environment you are running RLPy in (e.g. it might be set in a terminalwindow but not in general).\nThis should have been configured by the installer script; if your RLPydirectory has moved since then, merely re-run the installer script andrestart your computer.\nS2: If the installer script fails to solve the problem, the easiest solution isto add the RL_PYTHON_ROOT variable to your IDE directly.In eclipse, go to window->preferences->pydev->interpreter Pydev->environment.There, add a variable called RL_PYTHON_ROOT and set its value to be the path toyour RLPy directory.\n===============================================================\nE: Generic messages about missing functions or 'module does not contain function xxx'\nS: Ensure you have the latest version of scipy (0.11 as of this writing):\nimport scipy\nscipy.version.version\nS-U: if you don't have the correct version, run the following commands\nsudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran python-pip\nsudo pip install scipy --upgrade\n===============================================================\nE: ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import\nS1: Dont import pylab directly. Use Matplotlib.pylab\nS2: sudo easy_install -U numpy\n===============================================================\nE: In eclipse sty is out of synch with the file system\nS: Refresh (F5)\n===============================================================\nE: In Windows: Python does not appear to be installed (Eclipsefails to locate python, or running 'python' in a command prompt gives'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operableprogram or batch file."\nS-W: Set the path variables for python as described in: ( http://docs.python.org/2/faq/windows.html )\n===============================================================\n\n\nPlease direct additional questions or bug reports to\nrlpy[at]mit[dot]edu\n*/Thanks to taag for the ASCII art (http://patorjk.com/software/taag/)
